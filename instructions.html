        <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>The main goal of this game is to have your team (Resistance or Spies) win 3 out of 5 total missions. </p>
        <h2>How is a Round/Mission Structured:</h2>
            <p>There are two elements to a Round/Mission: 1)Selecting how goes on the mission, and 2)When those on the
                mission pass/fail the mission according to how they play that mission in accordance to their roles.</p>
            <h4>Mission Selection Process:</h4>
                <p>Players alternate nominating players to go on the mission, according to how many players are required on the
                    mission. Spies want to try to put other Spies on the mission while Resistance members want to avoid Spies
                    being on the mission at all costs. After 5 rejected proposals then the Spies automatical gain a point.</p>
            <h4>Passing and Failing a Mission:</h4>
                <p>Once players have been selected to be on missions, these individual players will "Pass" or "Fail" a mission. "Failing" a mission
                    can only be done by a Spy. Furthermore, certain missions will require more than on "Fail" vote to "Fail" the mission. However,
                    for the majority of the missions, only 1 "Fail" vote is required to "Fail" a mission.</p>
        <h2>How to win:</h2>
            <h4>Resistance:</h4>
                <p>The Resistance Wins if 3 missions Pass. Furthermore, they must ensure that the Spies, in particular the Assasin, can't
                    correctly guess who Merlin is.</p>
            <h4>Spy:</h4>
                <p>Spies win by either: 1) Successfully "Failing" 3 missions, or 2) Correctly assasinating Merlin upon Resistance Victory. </p>
        <h2>Special Roles:</h2>
            <p>Merlin: Merlin knows which players are Spies with the exception of Mordrid. Furthermore, Spies are able 
                to win even though the Resistance has won 3 missions if the Assasin is able to distinguish which players is 
                Merlin and kills him/her.</p>
            <p>Assasin: This is the Spy who is to guess who Merlin is upon Resistance victory in an attempt to win the 
                game for the Spies.</p>
            <p>Percival: This character knows who Merlin (Resistance) and Morgana (Spy) are but does not know which one is which.</p>
            <p>Mordrid: This is the only Spy who Merlin can not see.</p>
            <p>Morgana: This characters key role is to confuse Percival in his knowing who Merlin is.</p>
            <p>Oberon: This character is the one Spy who does not know who the other Spies are nor do they know this character is a spy.</p>
